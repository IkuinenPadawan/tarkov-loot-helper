# Tarkov Loot Tool

Tarkov Loot Tool aims to help Escape From Tarkov players find out quickly and easily what items to sell and what items to keep for quests and hideout upgrades.

## Motivation

Idea for the project was born while playing Escape From Tarkov and checking every item in the Tarkov Wiki website whether that item was needed for a quest or hideout upgrade. The tediousness of it created an idea of a tool that helps to determine quickly what items to keep.
