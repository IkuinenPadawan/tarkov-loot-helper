# Tarkov Loot Tool

## Motivation

Idea for the project was born while playing Escape From Tarkov and checking every item in the Tarkov Wiki website whether that item was needed for a quest or hideout upgrade. The tediousness of it created an idea of a tool that helps to determine quickly what items to keep.
